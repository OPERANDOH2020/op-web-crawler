#OPERANDO Web Crawler

Web Crawler gets a list of OSPs URLs and the according credentials to log in, to fetch the privacy settings of the OSPs so that the WatchDog can determine whether new settings have been introduced.

Similarly, Web Crawler browses the pages where OSPs share their privacy policy and sends them to WatchDog to determine whether the OSP introduced new terms.
